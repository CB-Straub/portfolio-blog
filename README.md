A minimially viable frontend blog project built with React v17, Json-Server(as a development prototype API mockup for data}, using React Context for state manangement.  

This is the very first react app I built....and is a work in progress. Problems/Solutions that will be addressed:  

Navbar Links need to have actual pages, About, Merch and Contact will be added as new pages with ther own compnonents and css
Images on individual blog pages look terrible with sizing being an issue. This app was built as a mobile first app, css needs to be addressed as it is     inline currently making responsiveness tricky.  Looking at moving the CSS styling from inline in the PostCard component and Post Page to separate           files.
json-server is being used for prototyping and a mock-up api data set.  This will be changed to a MongoDB Atlas database and Express.js/Node.js will         take this to  a full MERN stack project.
