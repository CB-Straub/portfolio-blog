I wanted to learn how to use json-server as a mock API database so I built this fake blog. I like music so I made it about music things. You can see small pictures on small devices and bigger pictures on bigger devices.  React is a nice framework for frontend business and lots of folks use it...so I used it here also....to show you I could. Because I promised to pay a school a bunch of money to teach me how to learn this React thing. And now I would like someone else to pay me to do this React thing...so I can pay that school. They keep asking. And food is nice.  Because an actual person is actually reading this.. right now... to hire me to make this blog for them.  If they are...email me at gansobc2@protonmail.com with the message...."manhatten shenanigan".   I used this thing called Concurrently, which means things that run at the same time, like prison sentences, because starting your frontend and backend with one command is easier than starting them separately sometimes.  I normally use React Redux for state management,  but I thought I would use a React Hook called useContext and Create Context instead.  It does the same thing just with different words that tell the computer to do it such a way. Way different than a Jab or Uppercut.   The styling called CSS was done by me and not the strap of someone elses boot, although those are cool to use too.  I don't know many coders...sorry....frontend backend full stack web developer software engineers...that wear boots anyway,  but we can make abbreviations for abbreviations like nobody's business. It's not like we have snippets that type the words for you.....actually we do....and I really like them.  Why sit when you can lie down? (that an actual Napolean quote, beacuse soldiers should always rest during war when they are not actually fighting...so they can be rested for fighting). I need to go lie down.
